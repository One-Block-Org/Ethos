# Aave/Arbitrum Unified: The High-Fidelity Execution Layer

**Project Name**: Atupa Unified Execution Suite
**Grant Requested**: $50,000
**Category**: Infrastructure & Developer Tooling
**Target Ecosystem**: Arbitrum (One, Nova, Orbit)

---

## 🏮 The Vision: Bridging the "WASM-EVM Gap"
The Arbitrum ecosystem is at a historical turning point with the launch of **Stylus**. While Stylus allows for massive compute efficiency in Rust/WASM, it introduces a "Visibility Black Hole" for the millions of existing Solidity developers.

**Atupa** is the first unified execution profiler that bridges this gap. Instead of forcing developers to use fragmented tools for different parts of a transaction, Atupa provides a contiguous, high-fidelity view of the entire **Hybrid Execution Path**.

## 🏗 Why Atupa vs. Niche Profilers?
Existing tools focus strictly on the WASM Native VM. Atupa focuses on the **Transaction Lifecycle**.

- **Hybrid Interoperability**: Atupa correlates standard EVM traces with Stylus HostIO traces. For the first time, a developer can see exactly how a Solidity call-stack transitions into a WASM logic-gate and back.
- **Unified Metrics**: We normalize standard Gas and Stylus Ink into a single, comprehensive "Cost-of-Execution" report.
- **Protocol-Awareness**: With built-in adapters for **Aave**, **GHO**, and **Lido**, Atupa doesn't just show opcodes—it shows protocol health.

## 🛠 Milestones (4 Months)

### Milestone 1: The Nitro Unified Tracer ($15,000)
- Develop the `atupa-nitro` adapter for stitching EVM and WASM traces.
- Implement the "Hybrid Flamegraph" engine.
- Deliverable: Alpha CLI tool (`cargo-atupa`) for local testing.

### Milestone 2: Institutional Protocol Adapters ($20,000)
- Integrate deep decoding for Aave v3, GHO, and Lido on Arbitrum.
- Implement "Liquidation-Efficiency" and "Oracle-Latency" tracking.
- Deliverable: Advanced profiling reports for cross-chain liquidity.

### Milestone 3: The Atupa Studio & CI Suite ($15,000)
- Launch the high-performance Web Viewer for interactive trace exploration.
- Implement GitHub Actions for "Hybrid Gas Regression" tracking.
- Deliverable: Full production suite and public documentation.
